Breast ultrasound   Assess unpalpable mass detected on physical mammography in the lower inner quadrant of breast in patient with rare non-bloody breast discharge.   The mass is not identified in the lower inner quadrant on the breast corresponding to the size and location of the unpalpable mass. There are external noises indicating that this is a liquid mass. Hyperechoic foci are not present likely indicating that iron is not present (confirmed on physical mammography). In the retroareolar region there was identified an extraductal mass with proximal ductal non-dilatation. This is inconsistent with an extraductal pappiloma.1. Liquid breast mass with iron 2.
