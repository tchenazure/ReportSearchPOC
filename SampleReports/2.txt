DIAGNOSIS: LIVER, BIOPSY: 1. CONSISTENT WITH PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS, STAGE 1. 2. PORTAL FIBROSIS (STAGE 1 OF 4). NOTE: Dr. Test’s progress note (4/28/14) is reviewed. The patient has a clinical history of primary biliary cirrhosis. Reportedly, the patient had a positive antimitochondrial antibody. The patient's previous liver biopsy (DPS-10-4275) showed changes which favored primary biliary cirrhosis. At that time, it was a stage 1 lesion. The patient currently has an elevated alkaline phosphatase (184). The biopsy shows three cores of liver tissue with approximately nineteen portal areas present for evaluation. Many of the portal areas show a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate, consisting predominantly of lymphocytes. A few of the portal areas show a marked chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. In these portal areas, florid duct lesions are present, characterized by the prominent inflammation, lymphocytic cholangitis, and bile duct epithelial damage/disruption of bile duct basement membrane. No granulomas are seen. Focally, there is bile duct loss, but there is no ductopenia. There is focal interface hepatitis, but this is not a prominent<br>digitally signed by<br>RG Go<br><br>date: 7/11/2023<br>time: 1:46:01 PM<br> <br>digitally signed by<br>RG Go<br><br>date: 7/11/2023<br>time: 1:47:12 PM<br> <br>
